Pocahontas
The men built 20 cabins and a fort to surround and protect the cabins.  They called their new town Jamestown.   But they were not the only ones living on that land.

Up and down the coast and for miles into the woods lived tribes of Native Americans.  This is the land that is now called Virginia. 


Back then, it was called the Powhatan Confederacy.  One chief ruled over 30 tribes in the Powhatan Confederacy, and his name was Powhatan. 

Chief Powhatan’s scouts told him that ships had landed on shore, and new men had built a fort and cabins.  They told him the new men spoke in words no one had ever heard before.  They wore clothes no one had ever seen before. </p>

    The King and Queen invited all the fairies in the kingdom to a Naming Party for the baby.  And what a party it was!  Plates and silverware of pure gold were set with care before each guest.  One fairy, whose name was Maleficent, had left 50 years before and had not been seen in all that time, showed up at the door.  Quickly the King and Queen whispered to the servants they must quickly find a place setting for the new guest.  Alas, the plate and the silverware the servants could find were not of pure gold.  This made the old fairy very angry.
    
    Soon it was time for each Fairy to give her blessing to the baby.  When it came to Maleficent’s turn, she stood up and pointed her long scraggly finger at the sleeping baby girl in the cradle.
    
    “I declare, before all of you,” Maleficent called out, ““that this child, on her 16th birthday, shall prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel, and die!”</p>

    <p>With a whoosh of smoke, the evil fairy vanished.  Everyone cried out with alarm, as you can imagine.  But one fairy had not yet given the baby her blessing.  The King and Queen asked this fairy, whose name was Merryweather, to reverse the curse.  Merryweather shook her head sadly –  that she could not do.  But she could soften the curse.“On her 16th birthday,” said Merryweather, “when the Princess pricks her finger on the spinning wheel, she will not die and instead will fall asleep for 100 years.”

        “Asleep for 100 years!” said the Queen.  “After our daughter turns 16, we will not know her anymore!”
        
        The King ordered every spinning wheel in the kingdom to be brought to the palace and burned.  To be extra sure the Princess would not be anywhere near a spinning wheel, he also ordered Merryweather, along with two other fairies, Flora and Fauna, to take the baby far away into the forest.

            The fairies would raise the child in a cottage deep in the woods.  They would keep her safe until after her 16th birthday.  Then it would be safe to bring the Princess, who had been named Aurora, back to the castle.
            
            Aurora grew up knowing no others than the three fairies, whom she knew as her aunts.  The animals of the forest were her friends and companions.  The birds and the deer, the chipmunks and the rabbits, followed her around as she fed them treats and cooed to them</p>

                From the time she was little, Aurora was told she must stay inside the hills that surrounded them.  She must never go beyond those hills!  That was fine with her, as the woods surrounding the cottage had plenty of room to play.
                
                One day when Aurora came home, she found her three aunts preparing for a party.  “What’s going on?” she said.
                
                “Tonight we celebrate your 16th birthday!” said Flora</p>
